          Magic Internet Money (MIM) is the first mainstream Bitcoin meme, originally created in 2013 and deployed a decade later on the Bitcoin blockchain by its original artist, Mavensbot.</p>
        <p className="text-2xl leading-relaxed text-wizard-black">
          It all began in the r/bitcoin subreddit, where Mavensbot posted his now-iconic MS Paint artwork of the “Magic Internet Money Wizard”. His drawing was later turned into a reddit ad to promote Bitcoin. It then became the most successful Reddit ad of all time and played a key role in Bitcoin’s early rise from $27 to $1,132, while helping grow the r/bitcoin subreddit community from 10,000 to over 100,000 subscribers by the end of 2014.

          This isn't just another meme coin—it's Bitcoin culture, history, and provenance immortalized on-chain. 
          Every wizard is raw, handcrafted, MS-Painted by the community, embodying the true decentralized spirit. 
          No corporate polish, no venture backing, just pure, uncut Magic Internet Money.

          A Digital Relic of Whimsy

          MIM exists as a digital relic of whimsy, devoid of utility, function, or purpose—except to serve as a beacon 
          of the playful chaos that defined Bitcoin's journey. It proudly occupies the intersection of art, history, 
          and inexplicable internet humor.
