          Born from the mystical depths of r/bitcoin in 2013, the Bitcoin Wizard emerged as a symbol of magic internet money. 
          Created by the legendary <a href="https://x.com/mavensbot">@mavensbot</a>, this MS Paint masterpiece became the beloved mascot of Bitcoin's early adopters—those

          and inexplicable internet humor.
